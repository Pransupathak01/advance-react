Custom Hooks: Sharing logic between components

1. React Custom Hooks are JavaScript functions starting with ‘use’ 
containing reusable logic and may call other Hooks.

2. We know that hooks like useState, and useEffect are reusable components. 
Sometimes we make components that we have to reuse again and again in the application. 
In this case, we can convert the component to hooks by extracting logic from it.

Reusable custom hooks:

 If we have code we would like to extract from a component, a custom hook might be 
 the proper extraction if the following conditions are met:

1.The extracted code has no JSX output (if it does, then you should create a component instead)

2.the extracted code includes calls to other hooks (if it doesn’t, then create a regular function instead)
