CDN / Server Level Optimization:
Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and server-level optimizations help deliver content more efficiently.

CDN Optimization:

1.Caching: Serve content from the nearest server to the user.
2.Compression: Use Gzip or Brotli to compress files.
3.HTTP/2: Use HTTP/2 for multiplexing and server push

"To use a CDN for loading React and ReactDOM in a React project, you typically modify the index.html file 
in your project's public directory. This file serves as the main HTML file for your application."

<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/17.0.2/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react-dom/17.0.2/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>

Points to Consider:

Bundling:

If you're using Webpack (or another bundler), make sure that your bundling process doesn't also include React and ReactDOM
in the output. This can be done using Webpack's externals configuration. Development vs Production:
"externals: {
    react: 'React',
    'react-dom': 'ReactDOM',
  },"

Use development versions of React and ReactDOM for development to benefit from warnings and error messages.
 For production, use the minified versions as shown in the example above for better performance.
Ensure Compatibility:

Ensure that the versions of React and ReactDOM you're including via CDN are compatible with your codebase.

"The externals property tells Webpack that react and react-dom should be treated as external dependencies. 
As a result, they won't be included in the bundle, and instead, the application will use the globally available
React and ReactDOM variables provided by the CDN scripts."
