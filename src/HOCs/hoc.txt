1. Higher Order Components (HOCs) are a tool that allows you to extend your component's
capabilities without sacriicing code clarity or creating unnecessary redundancies.

2. Higher-order-components are a design pattern in React where a function takes a components
as an argument and returns an enhanced new component.

3. In simpler terms, Hocs are functions that wrap existing components, providing them with additional
props or behaviors.

4. The main benefit of HOCs is that they enable us to extend functionality of diferent components
without repeating same code in each of them. This promotes a code reuse an enhances the
maintainbility of your React applications.

Approces to Hocs - There are two approaches to implementing HOCs:

1.Passing the original component as parameter
2.Render Props Approces
